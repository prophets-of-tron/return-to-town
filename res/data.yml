    - intro: Having passed through the swampland, you come across a broken boatshed which has progressively shrugged its way into the murky weeds. On the edge of the boathouse is a white sheet of paper tacked to a photograph which you cannot see. The floor is dense enough to walk on, but any sudden movements of quick tempered steps will lead to an unplanned journey through the mud.
      observe: |-
        Creeping to the shack, you see the note and the photograph in greater detail. You cannot get far enough to touch the objects, but sight was always your strong suit. It reads:
        {style}Those who make us are those who we appreciate the most, until they are taken away.You have a company, a life, a loving gaggle of slaves following your every step in the form of corporate stooges and kiss-ups, but do you have somebody who cares about you? Do you have somebody who actually wants you to survive for the sake of you, not your wealth or resources?  You once had Sara, but then she slowly turned away from you. I made that happen, like you made my life happen. I think that fundamentally describes our relationship: I create, I live, and I suffer while you destroy, consume, and walk unscaved. Not Anymore. I have her. You know who I mean, she is with me. Follow the river, you may have enough time to save the one innocent person in your realm of influence.{:style}
        The pen’s ink is rather fresh when compared to the other notes you have received. It would seem that it has been posted here for around two to three days. The air is quite and full of a light dew, as the night rolls into a new and darker phase.
      investigate: The path rolls along to the north and the river lies to the east. In all other directions the lonely wood stretches on for an eternity.

    - intro: You decide to approach the edge with careful curiosity. The wood is rotten and decaying with dyed patches of green mold. The smell from the corpse is putrid and spicy, almost pleasant enough to scrape your skin off. The glass from the bent windows has long fell into the deep water which lies on the borders of the moist dirt. A moss ladder of vinyl structure climbs the interwoven boards to form a cape hanging from the back of the shack. The whole patch of forsaken ground breaths with heavy terrain lungs, exhaling the rough sketch of nature and her myriad of horrors. You notice that the rubber soles of your shoes have eroded to become a mere scrubbable coating on the blistering pods of your feet. The leather has stretched and molded to the contours of your arching heel and cracked to piece into the callus pads.
      observe: Somehow you manage to maintain your weighted constitution as you slowly start of approach the shack. You reach your hand to the doorknob, but you notice that this, like all other metal, has escaped into the modern day along time again, leaving behind this skeleton of sticks and knots. You reach your hand to the door as it falls apart in your grasp. Stepping over the mulch, you see a chest. The chest has clearly been here for many years, having rusted around the lower corners. A small desk juts out at the front where a ticket window might have stood. There is a map on the wall of the campground which reveals many interesting geological points. You have come across a stream which is fed from the much larger river that runs from the state border to the ocean. It has been blocked by the development of a thick briar patch to the west. To the north, a marshland stretches for miles. The campground was originally much drier, but the construction of paths and artificial land ruined the composure of the balanced river valley. To the northeast, a second mountain crater reaches around the borders of a manmade lake. This was a centre attraction for the campsite which boasted majestic river living. It was a “Happy Valley,” indeed.
      search: |-
        You creek open the box to find preserved books and a pyramid of scratched financial documents. Picking up the top book, you find a magazine with the title “The Best for Our Happy Valley Campers.” Inside you find a series of articles on the major customers who came back again and again. The text, quality of image, and cigarette ad reveals the age of this relic. Towards the start of the features, you find an article about a talent show they had near the artificial lake on a floating stage. Small children dressed in Scout uniforms and woodland dress hold colourful props and tools to demonstrate their woodland capabilities. On the cover of the article, a young boy is shown singing with a blue bowtie and a large blasier. On the side of the image, a caption reads:
        “Frank Wallace shows his Sinatra style as Pop Joseph Wallace watches and beams. These two Valliers have been with us since 1953, and have returned twelve times since. Frank wants to be a miner when he grows up, like his father.
        In the back of the stage a large man with an unshaven chin and red pint smiles widely at his talented son.
        Investigate: The north is impassable due to the heavy swampland, the river has grown fierce to the south, but it remains passable to the western portion.

    - intro: You poke in to the running stream with the edge of your decomposing soles. The water is cool, stinging you blistering toes. You see the flow of the river dipping down a slight slope towards a wider basin. You also see a mat of wadded garbage pinned to a rock, caught in the current. While walking down the sediment, small creatures climb between your unshaven leg hairs, creating quick brushing sensations which slowly twist at the edge of your sanity.
      observe: Walking up to the rock, you see the mat in better detail. The decaying gloss of an adult entertainment magazine page has sprouted into a blooming mold. The pages are thin and pulpy as the edge of the cover creases and lumps down from your grasp. The cover shows some individual with hanging cloth desperately clinging to the landing gear of a military jet. A cowboy hat drapes from her neck as the world shrinks with their altitude.
      search: Opening the pages to reveal their content is no easy task. The pages cling to each other as if some glue or adhesive gasps each ink blot. After some time you are able to isolate a heavily read article. On the first page, there is a full print picture of yourself, tall in stature and proud in posture. The article is titled,”How to Remake the World: An Investigation Into Savage Innovation.” It labours on for paragraphs describing every achievement, every product, and every milestone you have passed in the history of your corporate efforts. Finally, at the last page of the article, the journalist drives into every crime, sin, or sacrifice of public safety which it took to become a multinational conglomerate. The last image is a small child, hard of hearing, striving off of a 3000 dollar IV bag with 400 micrometre saline solution inside. A chemical, a product, a child saved.
      investigate: The stream continues flowing into the basin to the east. The rough border of swampland before a vast marsh crackles to the north, northeast, and west. To the northwest, the origin of the stream, a small hill from the thicket to the west, opens onto your current location. To all southward directions stretches the wall of tall, intimidating trunks.
    - intro: You enter the wider basin of the stream. Though the diameter of the river is slightly wider than the trickle to the west, the depth remains the same. A few scattered collections of boulder sections are dotted along the edges of the bank. The sand beneath the bouncing surface flows in smooth lines as if the river had been molding a zen garden. There are small disruptions in the pattern from the footprints of animals who had been traversing this unusual plane of the forest. The air is thick, dense, with an ever present tinge of stinging pine which bites at the nose with nostalgic ambivalence. You do note a change in the flowing pattern around the edge of the rocks.
      observe: You walk closer to the rocks to find some wooden planks resting on the surface of a rock. The boards twitch, trapped between the wall and the flowing current. Looking closer, you notice that the boards were once part of a larger structure. Flipping them over, you see a logo,” Kurtz Boating Rentals.” Over the edges of low moss, you see the outline of a boathouse to the northwest.  The wreckage was placed between the rocks at an angle flowing along the current from the west, so further wreckage could have bobbed down the watery path.
      investigate: The river flows from the west to the east. The northern direction is followed by a brief piece of passable terrain followed by a dense swamp which is obviously impassible.
    - intro: Onto the river you go, seeing new footsteps under the surface. These are clearly the heavy footsteps of a man and the smaller footsteps of a young child. Random, whitewashed boards have collected at the bank over the years, acting as arrows pointing towards some far off oblivion. You hear the small chirp of a bird, a wonderful living creature which calls into the night. The moonlight reflects off the water with a snickering roll of the tongue. The water has grown deeper since the sections of the river to the west. The icy lips of the water’s skin grapple around the curtails of your waist. The two currents sweep you onto your knees. Your chin barely touches the water and burns with an aquatic acidity. In the water, you feel small lumps under the sand.
      observe: You use your chilled hands to scrape the sand away from the bodies below. First, you find the rusted edge of a bullet casing which had been fired recently, due to the cover of sand over it. Similarly, you find the cap of some sort of needle. Finally, you find the smashed remnants of a bottle. You clamber back to your feet with the shard of glass containing a slippery logo. It reads,” DANGER CHEMICAL POISON.” It is a military carcinogen which your company sells to private prisons for lethal injections. Taped to the smashed bottle are numerous bandages with depictions of your daughter’s favourite cartoon characters. Judging by the sharp edges of the bottle, it must have been smashed around the same time that the bullet was fired.
      investigate: The river flows from the west to the east. The northern direction is followed by a brief piece of passable terrain followed by a dense swamp which is obviously impassible.
    - intro: Using a board from along the edges of the river, you balance yourself as the current of the frigid water gains geometric speed. The serine nature of the western waters has cascaded into a frantic rush, circuslike in its playful whirlpools and ripples. Bobbing along the uneven surface comes a rubber tire, flailing its grooves and cohesive patterns along like a dog wagging its damp tail. As you wade further into the deep, the water raises to nip at the edges of the pectoral muscles. Your shirt clings to your skin which simply highlights the burning sensation of your exposed, burned, and bruised skins. You also see a tanned flap of floating material making rude noises on the edge of the tire.
      observe: You push with all of your strength to grapple with the side sweeping wave. Your legs feel grouped by an invisible hand and your nerves pierce through pulsating regions of rapidly changing temperature and pressure. It is an ocean of chaos. You eventually grap the tire with your outstretched hand. At the same time, your knees buckle and you fall, face first, into the water. The blast of liquid seeps through your swollen eyelids to provide an operant relief. In a brief moment, you feel an intense mortification at your wretched condition. The tire escaped you after your tumble, but the thin fabric remains stable in your grasp. Lifting yourself up, you peel the wrap from your face and breath a scratchy breath.
      search: On the fabric, you first notice a plastic identity card. The image looks shockingly similar to your demonic captor. The purpose of the card, with its pine tree outlines and small font, is for renting some sort of carbon. On the interior of what you assume is a wallet is the imprinted outline of a key. There is also a waterlogged photo of a smiling man with a shadowed chin and welcoming eyes. A dead man.
      investigate: The river continues flowing from the west to the east. The current is just weak enough to allow a waddling motion upwards. To the north lies the remainder of a small wooden shack on the border of the swamp. To the south lies a brief marshland which is surrounded by pencil-like white birch.
    - intro: Finally a rocky edge cascades below you, leaving your weak skeleton to wrestle with the calmed current. You find yourself barely able to float above water, but sufficient enough that you would not drown. Roots from trees create canopies and reaching tunnels in the shallower edges to the water. Lily Pads and weeds poke their heads just far enough to pep out on the surface. Small insects and larger amphibians or rodents nip along the stream with the crumbling remains of the campgrounds foodstuff. On one branch which reaches deep into the curvy biological labyrinth, a blindingly orange parachute cord strangles the bark and waddles down behind your view in a pocket of the riverbed.
      observe: |-
        The southern side of the river had been slightly raised. The dense tree cover and fast waters make navigation (and general mobility) difficult. The water has learned to glide by the more tangential stalks which piece the skin. Mud has draped itself over every nook and cranny of land. As you doggy paddle down the river, you edge aside the block, revealing the hidden corner which is highlighted by the man made polymer. You find a raft, and it could only be described as something that crude, hitched to the anchor above. The flotation is provided by foam mannequins with plywood boards straddled around it. Duct tape and the result of a poorly handled nail gun have made the stability of the device questionable at best. On the top of this wreck lies a wooden paddle from a standard canoe which has been freshly painted red. On the top of the raft lies a note,
        {style}If you want her, you must continue your more destructive habits. Using others, going along, rejecting logic and rationality for gain and certitude. Climb you chariot and finish this at the place where nature has selected.{/style}
        After reading this rather cryptic message, you look northeast above the treetops. A rocky peak just scrapes the sky over the myriad of pine and moss encasing you. The note wishes you to cross the valley by floating down the river in the raft.

    # campfire
    - intro: Creeping into the opening, you are greeted by a pleasant surprise, civilisation. Four logs have been carved into benches and lie in a sand circle facing towards a circle of large stones. In the circle, a black soot has developed on the edges of the stone. A drip of smoke creeps out from the charcoal. The sand underneath the scene is damp and slightly brown from exposure to moisture and pressure.
      observe: The the woods surrounding the campsite there is little to observe. However, at the edge of one of the benches there is a small, pink backpack. There is little evidence of who left the luggage considering the trackable mud from the previous clearings has been replaced with the sand. There is a wooden sign with peeling paint nailed to a tree which reads,”Pine Clearing”
      search: You close in on the pack before you note the famous cartoon logo on the front. When you open the backpack, which is notably damp, you find nothing but the remains of dirt and crumbs.
      investigate: You note that the previous clues have been located in the south to east sections of the wood. There is no sign or path leading away from the campfire, but this is clearly some sort of edge or boarder.

    # Frank 3
    - intro: The a short distance you find yourself looking at a crude shelter made of thick branches and mud. There are footprints and glovemarks in the mud on the ground and on the tent. An interesting note is that these imprints are not made by a single person, there appears to be two figures with a large and small stature respectively. Perhaps a family had been hunting in the area. There is an opening to the tent facing north. Inside, you hear a faint noise.
      observe: The trees around you are older and worn. Moss and fungi dot the branches as the tall stalks lie dismembered from the weathered storm. This patch is significantly lighter from the reduced canopy above. The shelter is malleable, as if it had been constructed within a relatively short period of time.
      search: Inside the cabin there is another message made with a large, glossy paper. It has your name on it. The message is attached to a brown paper bag which has decayed into pulp over the passing of time. There is no floor to the cabin, just two large imprints besides the bag about the length of a coffin. Opening the bag, spoiled paperwork drops out. The ink has run down the page and dried to form an uneven crust. The paperwork is from some sort of order form. Looking closer at the document, you recognize the logo of your corporation. The form details an attempt to purchase A25iJ with private funds. The person, a Frank Wallace has attempted this purchase ten times, being denied for a lack of funds on every repetition. You recognize the signature from the previous documents, you have seen them before.
      investigate: The previous note remains to the southwest. In all directions the woods continue in various states of decay. To the north, you can sense the smell of smoke and a faint hint of pine. Perhaps it is nothing.

    # Frank 2
    - intro: The hill dips down into a valley. One might think that such a coven could be a safe haven, but recognize the inherent danger which lies below the surface. Three trees have been organised in a triangular form on the ground. In the centre of the trees a manila envelope lies in a ziplock bag. On top of the bag is a green bow.
      observe: You become slightly frightened at the notion that these woods seem to fall along an infinite regression. Are you in a limbo of arbolian design?
      investigate: The thick brayer patch continues to the west, its impassable. Thick stalks of wood and desne layers of leaves continue in all directions like a botanist’s sea.
      interact: You stumble down to the tree as if your frame cannot help but bow before its druic presence. By unzipping the green, plastic lock you are greeted with the odious vapour of cigarette smoke and cinnamon. Peeling back the envelope you see a photograph fall into your hands. It shows two men in a hospital room. The glean shine of the picture practically blinds you. An older man lies in bed with various tubes and strings dressing his limp limbs. He is obviously uncomfortable as deduced by the wrinkled bedsheets and flattened pillow. Another figure dressed in flannel with a thick, brown jacket sits on the side of the bed. His head rests in his hands. His mud covered boots twist with the signs of fear and utter torment. The older man looks similar to him. Searching the envelope further you see various papers with colour coded margins. Each is labeled by bold letters reading CLASSIFIED: GENERAL HOSPITAL. A man named Wallace had been checked in for lung cancer five times. After three days he was dispelled for not having the proper insurance. Finally there is a glossy pamphlet which blasts pastel tones and heavy blues. It is from your company. The drug A25iJ, a tonic made to relieve mortal pain, is being held by elderly angels and wise doctors with flashing smiles. The medicine was prescribed to Wallace, but never administered due to financial concern.

    # Sara 5
    - intro: After crossing along the edge of the path, you place your foot on the rather poorly constructed wooden bridge. The planks groan under your weight as every step proves to be a new gamble. The wide water remains relatively thin, as if this moist tundra was unnatural or otherwise disturbed. On the guardrail which could snap under the weight of a cereal box, ropes and locking mechanisms hang bolted to some invisible limb. The general foliage is muted and sparse when compared to the dense and solomon stalks from the other sections of the forest. On the other side of the bridge, you see a post with rusty nails poking out of the edges. The platform is rather long, running for twenty metres, but it has a nice arc which may or may not have been intentional.
      observe: |-
        Looking closer at the post, you notice how it seems to be at a rather strange angle with the top being rather spiky and precarious. It points towards the lagoon. Crossing to look into its depth, you see the a dense collection of floating plant life which reaches its green tentacles up in a daintily waving mass. Collected from the friction of the obstacle is a large, sunbleached sign whose bright letters read:
        {style}COME TO WOODLAND COVE
        HERE AT HAPPY VALLEY CAMPGROUND
        FAMILY, FUN, WATER!{/style}

        The image shows a massive lake with canoes and floating structures bouncing around the waves. Small children beam with the excitement that can only come from a child actor in the 1960s. Features from the ad include: rentable kayaks to explore a woodland river, boat rides, and a tire swing. The lake seems to be placed in front of a large mountain, on every similar to the rocky peak on the northeast horizon.
      investigate: To the north and south lies the lake which narrows onto a bank. To the east lies a gravel road and another structure of some kind. To the west lies the edge of the path and a small dirt trail leading to the northwest.
    # Sara 6
    - intro: You continue onto the eastern bank of the opening of the lagoon. The structure you saw was a tall cabin-like building with a large “employees only” sign on it. The letters are carved out of wood with a chipping green paint darkening the cavities. Surrounding the building is a collection of birch trees and overgrown weeds. The cabin has the smell of a basement with the pleasantries of a backwoods outhouse. Behind the cabin, a thin stream trickles down an eroding channel, heading into a second collection of brine. This water is much slower with mud and roots drinking the water as the straw directs the flow into their thirsty compartments.
      observe: |-
        You walk closer to the cabin, its relative structure proving to be a kind hope, to see a nailed bulletin board on the wall. There are two papers tacked onto it behind a protective shield of glass. One sign has a headline which says,” Genuine Cabin Experience, ” with a picture of a small wooden cabin in a clearing surrounded by forest land. Apparently this cabin could be rented for a week and allow somebody to live in the remains of a campsite which has been abandoned for up to seventeen years. You find this whole situation oddly familiar. The design and comic sans font tells you that the sign was made somewhere around the turn of the century. The second paper is larger and made of a blinding white paper with a few key words typed in a strict, black font. The paper is a notice which reads:
        {style}Abandoned Area
        Unsafe for Any Use
        DO NOT ENTER
        Radius extends 20 miles
        Environmental Protection Agency Logistics Division
        (2010){/style}

        Below the text lies a small map demonstrating the area of the twenty mile radius. You recognise its rough geography from other maps you’ve found about the borders of Happy Valley Campground, but the new satellite imagery shows the lagoon being much smaller and there being less woodland surrounding the area. The image makes the whole valley look rather overgrown and decrepit.
      search: You progress to the cabin door. It appears that after the damnation, any attempt to secure the facility was abandoned, leaving the door unlocked. You enter the room sized office structure which looks stripped of any life defining its function. The walls are plastered with a loud geometric pattern wallpaper. There are what appears to be three workstations which have all been collected in a pile in the corner with a sheet lying in front of them. A large window in the side of the office looks over the edge of the lagoon, but in such an awkward manner that the lagoon must have been misplaced or the window oddly framed. In the opposite corner, a box lies piled to the side, full of some random, multicoloured paperwork. You approach the box and discover a series of financial records and deeds. It is as if this box was where all secrets go to die. You start picking through the meaningless expense reports and find a few key details from a select few. Firstly, the dates go as far back as a 1955 proof of purchase. The Naja valley was purchased by a Alfred Randolph from the forestry reserve. He then sold the park back in 1985. The most interesting details came surrounding a major relationship with a landscaping company. These builders were hired for years to extricate a large body of land and fill it with enough water to drown a large aquarium. You then notice a side door behind the desks. Peeking through its impossible entryway, you see a picture of a large man with balding black hair and large, cheesy grin. The caption reads that this is Al Randy.
      investigate: To the north lies the remaining edge of the lagoon. To the south lies some mild, overgrown woodland. To the west lies the lagoon proper and the bridge to cross it, and directly to the east, a gravel road continues to march through the complicated labyrinth of nature.
    # Path 1
    - intro: You step onto the gravel and the small, chopped rocks crush under your feet. This makes a rough, chalky sound which hails as an ever present reminder that you have, at last, reached some refuge of civilisation. The road is wider than any other path you’ve seen to this point, about six metres across, and cools your aching feet. You notice how the bulging woodland has attempted to cut through your paradise but has been stopped by the hard boot of manmade mastery. An interesting note is how the terrain seems to smooth as you trek along, getting easier to step. You also notice two small valleys which crawl down the road, perfectly parallel. The mud from under the road squeezes into the spaces between the rocks, like peanut butter collecting in the pores of snack crackers.
      observe: You note a small gleam of light that reflects off the ground. Walking to investigate, you see small, torn pieces of glossy celluloid stuck between the adhesive wet dirt and jagged small stones. Outside of the fragments, you can see some sort of plastic pipe exposed on the side of the road which runs on the length of the path, perhaps it leads somewhere.
      search: Looking closer at the photos, you can organise the shards into their original, rectangular appearance. A figure stands tall and proud in fine dressware. Around them, piles of money tip over and flow like great cascading waves. The whole aurora of the person is regal and grand. Or, at least it would be, if the photo wasn’t discarded along an abandoned trail. You briefly look at the other side of the photos whose surface runs like a white desert. In the middle of this plane you see a sharp black line which squiggles its way through the ocean of blank. You recognize the form of the photo to be your signature. Above, your suave text reads,” To Sara, Merry Christmas”  The faint smell of your deodorant creeps from the seams of the seal. Erased oil marks smear a portion of the surface which is stained a permanent scarlett.
      investigate: Ahead of you to the east, the path continues and seems to even out. To the west, the start of the path meets the large, tundric lake. To the south, an enchanted cove of birch and maple extends into the night, decaying its sweet pleasantries in foreboding brutality.
    # Path 2
    - intro: |-
        You continue onto the smooth path. The chunks of rock curb at the edge of larger, lighter stones. The terrain looks like the cracked surface of baked bread with a myriad of winding cracks and cliffaces creating a puzzle-like platform. The two parallel lines build to a collected slope at the foot of the transition. The rough pattern continues as the two streaks transform from transplanted stones to dark mud tracers. A large wooden sign hands off of fallen trees. They have fallen to that the tips of their branches scrape the edge of the road, making it passable enough so that no attempt was made to move them. Whoever left this place did so without any hesitation. Walking forward, you read the sunbleached sign whos brilliant pastels great you like a homophobic convention centre. It depicts a large basin with a multitude of small islands. On these islands, two or three awkwardly grown pine trees serve as barriers and guardians of the great body of water. The advertisement depicts a family performing activities around the site: a teenager with jet black hair waterskiing, his father who has the face of David Letterman and the attitude of Alex Trebek driving the white boat, a mother with a canoe paddle wadding along in a smaller wood craft, and a daughter swimming near the islands with a large orange towel spread across the beach. They all hold smiles that would make a clown blush. The sign reads:

        Woodland cove water park
        FUN, ADVENTURE, EXCITEMENT!!!
        A NEW FAMILY ADVENTURE FOUND ONLY AT HAPPY VALLEY CAMPGROUND
        From the details of the sign and fashion of the figures, you can date the sign to being somewhere around the 1970s. The last detail which piques your interest is the edge of a large, floating structure in the back of the photo. It looks as if a barge was transformed into a larger stage. Judging by the size of the structure, it could not have survived in natural waters. It was made for the basin specifically.
      observe: You note a small purple flower which grows between the cracks of the curb. Its petals stretch out to reach the sunlight while maintaining a wilted, drooping stance. Its stem is a flashing green with soft white hair poking out like the facial hair of a fifteen year old. A white band streaks across the centre of the lily, creating a zone of mixed pink. The roots of the plant reach into the soil, deep and plump. The plant has a mesmerising capability, it completely overrides you attention. However, the miracle of life is nothing when compared to the pain of your striking stomach, driving you to move from the floral paradise
      investigate: The path curves down to the south, heading straight into the horizon. To the north, the edge of the tundra plains collect towards the extended lake. To the west, the path heads towards the southern edge of the lake basin. East of the path, a small, quaint hilly woodland forms the border of the path.

    # Sara 3
    - intro: The trail leads to the edge of a riverbank. The actual river is quite a ways away, but the trial could seamingly go in either direction along its run. The water is wide, stretching a great distance to the treeline far away. Water lilies and cattails mark the border of the soggy field. Following the path you find a small brown bag with blue beads sewn into its weaving. The bag lies haphazardly in the mud on the side of the trail. The bag has started to sink into the moist soil, but it is not unreachable.
      observe: The bag is a modern bag made with a high quality of craftsmanship. It looks similar to the handbag of your secretary. The trail is dense but the soft ground has the marks of footsteps. A small diamond and hole pattern lies repeating in the northwest direction along the river. Near the bag’s location, there is also a glint of shiny red. When you pick it up, you see that it is a left heel shoe. The tall grass creates a natural boundary against the edges of the riverbank.
      search: You decide to investigate further, considering the uncanny situation in front of you. When you open the bag, contents scatter on the ground. There is a golden lipstick dispenser, a wallet with various discount cards and notes in unreadable handwriting, and a picture of you with worn edges. The bag is otherwise empty with the exception of some mint wrappers and some small chunks of matter.
      investigate: The river lies in front of you to the north and curves slightly to the northeast and east. The trail continue in whether the northwest or southeast directions. To the south and west lie continued woods, the natural prison which you have seemed to have overcome.

    - intro: Walking around the curved path, you come along the start of a long straight away which shoots south as straight as an arrow. The path’s numerous cracks start to fuse into a connected road. The chips of a painted centerline are scattered along the edges of the valleys and chips of the concrete plane. The woods on the edges of the path have become notably less dense, as if cared for at some point in the past. While mangy and overgrown, it has that key design of something which a person has touched. The road is marked with two dark lines which have become spread over the surface. These tiremarks are faint, but clearly recent. They have been placed within the last two days. While the more tamed manner of transport was a relief at first, repeated steps on an unmoving surface has begun to press against the backs of your legs. The collected heat from the day’s sun has radiated to form an oven which bakes the painful loafs. Sweat has condensed on your skin to form a convection of salts and sensation. Miniscule winces of pain rocket around your body. Your fine, silk shirt has not only ripped from the exposure to the elements, but the constant pressure and contortion has formed a dark region of warped fabric. Your fine, pristine appearance from the gala has been reduced to a skinny, groping form.
      observe: You look up from the path to observe the sky. The navy atmosphere with small point of illumination both settles your heart and upsets your body. Long, cool shadows from the moon’s light cascade the landscape in a variety of rotating shades. The crackle of fallen twigs and leaves has previously provided some comfort. A white noise to cover your tracks, safety in the wilderness. The silent road is haunted by the screams of previous vacations and excited footsteps, now cast in a deep depressed despair. Abandoned, alone, cast from safety you crumble along until, in the midst of the path, you see a single leaf. Lying on the dark line and highlighted by its contrast, the leaf is a youthful and transparent green. It practically glows from a magical bioluminescence. However, you can clearly detect that some of the perceived holy light has been provided by a pool of liquid which circulates around the leaf. The gothic sight is displayed like a museum case from the hole of glow by the shadows that the trees cast around. The sight resembles a pupil, with the green traveler being a great iris in the moniclaic ruin. Approaching slowly, you lift the leaf to hold it closer to your eye. As you start to apply force, a thick sent strikes your nose. The leaf becomes stuck to the ground, requiring a strict tug to set it free. With this final effort, like a raised coffin lid, a dead body is revealed. A small, unrecognisable rodent corpse is splayed out as a feast to your starving eyes. The blood has been crushed out of the creature like an apple press straining juice. The succulent organs have fried on the heat of the driveway. The leaf did not provide protection from the weight of the automobile.
      investigate: The path continues back north and further southwards to the final destination. The borders are protected by the comfortable woods.

    # Sara 1
    - intro: You are rather disturbed by the notion that you were dragged by some lunatic through the muck into a dark cave, only to be forced to solve his riddles. It all seems rather absurd. You turn the corner around the rock to see a small red light glittering behind a tree. Heading there, you see a small basket tied to a tarp with a phosphorus flare glaring on the side.
      observe: The basket clearly fell from between a gap in the leaves above you. The sky is dark with beams of light peeking from between the cloud tips. The basket is rather plain with a plastic seal surrounding its contents. Looks more like a muffin basket, but you are grateful anyway. The tarp was clearly some sort of parachute.
      investigate: Behind you to the west is the cave and its clearing. In all other directions the nature speaks out with a yawning suspension, a pause with no extension but a vacuum.
    - search: |-
        Coming to the basket you rip off the tarp and protective plastic. Inside you see a small cookie and a note. It is clearly from your office’s stationary. It reads:
        {style}Mr. Davis, I’m afraid we have a bit of a predicament. You have been missing for three days now. I was personally terrorfied at the idea that you might have perished. Fortunately, we have received notification through an anonymous benefactor that you might have been brought to this area. Assuming the pilot followed his instructions, this should have landed east of the large patch of thickets. If you continue westwards, you will find a path to bring you home. In case you were hungry, I added your favourite snack. Yours truly, Miss. Sara{/style>

    # Sara 4
    - intro: Heading up through the river edge you come across an actual path. The road has the marking of tire tracks leading to the northeast. This area seems to be some sort of parking lot. A crumbling shed lies to the side of the circular path which curves into itself. In the shed you see a scribbled note, which you cannot read from this distance.
      observe: |-
        Coming closer to the shed, you find unused golf cart tires and a small box of nuts and bolts. There is a map of the camp glued in a broken white box. The map has become so sunbleached that the graphics have become a large white plain with darker edges. The note is made scratched by poor handwriting and carries the message:
        {style}Sir,
        The search party has proved useless, and all messages have failed to be received. You have now been missing for six days and I can’t afford to wait for you any longer. You have either passed where I cannot follow or you did this to hurt me, either way I am scared. When you find this note, know that those cookies were supposed to be cookies of friendship, not burnt husks of betrayal. If I had know that your cold and distant nature had been an act for a scared little weakling, I would have left this company a long time ago.
        -Yours not truly,
        Sara{/style}

        The pen’s ink is rather fresh when compared to the other notes you have received. It would seem that it has been posted here for around two to three days. The air is quite and full of a light dew, as the night rolls into a new and darker phase.
      investigate: The path rolls along to the north and the river lies to the east. In all other directions the lonely wood stretches on for an eternity.

    # Path 4
    - intro: Another step. Another destination. Continuing on and on and on and on and on forever more. The path fuses into an unbreaking plane, a full road. This road is grey like elephants hyde and peaked towards the middle. The tire tracks from mud have all but disappeared, continuing down the path of resignation. The connection between man and nature has started to blur as his footprint overtakes the mud. You also notice a series of crows, fluffles of feathers and cynicism, collecting around some target. With your approaching presence they fly off in a sudden panic. The ligaments between their torso and wings pulse as their mass is propelled into the sky. Walking, closer, slower, you see what they were so interested in. A bag of cookies have been tosses at some velocity to spread crumbs down in a steak like a bloodstain. Small candies with sugar smiley faces lie, partially consumed by the murderous flock. The destruction of the left eye makes the appearance that, in the face’s final breaths, it gave up on fulfilling its only purpose in life, to bring joy. Joy, like confectionary satisfaction, was drained by the long, straight road. Life, your daughter, Sara, the company, and every other beating thing in your life comes at you in a flash of dread. However, you cannot rest here. The road awaits.
      observe: As you crawl away from the horrid scene, you notice a faint sensation across your shoulder. A wind has started to blow, firm and fast, along the road. It stretches out and exhales accordingly. It has obviously been allowed to roam from the more sparse woodlands and reduced barriers, refreshing your face and chilling your bones. The sudden panic which overtook your paranoid lobes messages at your senses. You here laughing and crying with sudden tears or shining love. Every emotion which has ever had the grace of touching your heart has returned, in this moment, to stab it. You have trouble identifying figures in the wood since the shaking of your eyes and moistening of your contortions has rendered your eyes useless. The animal core has overtook you in the race for survival. How can you comete? You are in its world, the world of disappointment for those who lack the will to strive. Finally, your tempers decompress as you have a sobering realisation, those were Sara’s cookies. If she threw them away, they no longer realise that you are alive. To the world and your inner self, you walk the land of the dead.
      investigate: The path continues back north and further southwards to the final destination. The borders are protected by the comfortable woods.

    # Sara 2
    - intro: Walking further down you find yourself in a strange, unnatural pass. The grass smells oaky and foul and the branches of the trees curve around the open space. The sky peaks through the remaining leaves to glow with the milky shine of the stars. There is a box wrapped in metallic paper with a blue ribbon lying next to a rock. You sincerely hope that whatever it is, that it wasn’t fragile.
      observe: You notice a light in the distance, most likely from a dying candle light, hanging outside a doorway in the east. It seems to be a log cabin in the distance. However, everywhere else you look, there is just endless vegetation as far as you can see.
      search: |-
        The box is well wrapped like the one before, but something is familiar about this one. As you open it, you realize why. Inside, there is another note from Sara:
        {style}If you have found this, please fire the flare we have left for you.  In case you already ate the other one, I also left another cookie for you. Please stay safe. Yours truly, Sara{/style}
        There is a flare gun with a few shots, and another cookie in the box. However, it is not clear if the cookie is fresh.
      investigate: There is a rock wall edge to the passage to the south, it is impassible. In all directions surrounding you, there are woods. To the east you can see the faint glimmer of smoke. It is not a thick cloud, but it has mass nonetheless.
    # Cabin
    - intro: Following the smoke, you are first shocked by the cut grass on the edge of the wood. This pattern of civilisation is quite rare from what you have seen previously. After the patch of cut grass there is a firmly constructed log cabin which stands in the ground with a cement base. To the other side of the cabin, you see the skeleton of an overgrown trail. There is a canoe rack to the left of the cabin, but there are no boats which rest in its arms. In from tof the cabin there are stone steps and a welcome mat.
      observe: There seems to be no light coming from the cabin, but the remains of a fire could explain the smoke. The path is so unkept that any coherence in its design has faded. The grass is slightly pressed, but this easily could have been the wind flowing through the trunks.
      search: You slowly walk inside the cabin, eeking its screen-wired door. The cabin is not large, about the size of a small outhouse, but its warmth and resources are a welcomed commodity. There is a fireplace with the remains of a small fire from a few nights before. You realise the date of the fire from a small book at the door which lists the guests as they enter and leave the facility. The last camper was a man named Frank Wallace. It has the logo for a small campsite,” Happy Valley Campground,” at the top. Apparently, you are at a campsite. No luggage or supplies remain. The spruce bunk beds have been stripped down to a slightly yellow mattress frame. There is a rug which lies on the floor with a slightly dizzying design of bright pinks and blues. The cabin is old and has nothing else to offer. It is the relic of some cheap land owner trying to grab a buck, something you would have appreciated in any other circumstance.
      investigate: Looking outside the cabin you try to chart your path. To the northwest you can follow the path as best you can. To the south the edge of the rocky valley edge continues sharply. In all other directions the valley floor is laid out for you.

    # Path 5
    - intro: |-
        The path had lead to a split, a t-junction, and you must decide where to go. The degraded nature of the camp has given way to becoming a full settlement of humanity. A monumental, wooden fence marks the end of the southern line. The centre of the cross is made from a darker colour cement than the pale grey road. The almost blue concrete is fresh, ranging from ten to twelve years in age. The southern path spills onto this comparatively fresh laid street like a river flowing into a waterfall. You do notice that the wooden fence has been patched and replaced since every board seems to sing its own symphony. One is a painted orange, covered in a thick dew. Another is a moldy grey with green slime moving up its foundation. The whole candy striped structure has a raggedy and ramshackled demure. A flat, plastic sign is nailed so that a blind man could read:
        {style}WOODLAND COVE
        ------>
        Talent SHow, Boating, and FUN!!!
        Artificial Lake and Wooden Structures Provided by Wallace Family Co.{/style}

        The remaining area of fence was plastered with adds for a “Wallace family Company,” which seemed to provide landscaping services. They seemed to have sponsored the whole camp, or have been very close with the managing department.
      observe: Beyond the fence, some brief woodland or grass was interrupted by a steep, rocky cliff face. The mountainous valley wall seems to turn further south past the borders of the campground. It is both majestic and terrifying in its shere scale.
      investigate: The road runs perpendicular to the much older stem. The fence prevents southern motion, and the rest of the area is covered by less dense birch trees and small, unkempt shrubs.
    # Path 6
    - intro: The road still radiates with the heat of the day, warming your overworked legs like a warm embrace. Your chest pangs with pain, stinging with emotional and physical pain. The smell of manufactured products overwhelm your senses, creating an uncomfortable nausea. The shredded edges of your pants leg tickle the newly formed blisters covering every inch of your skin. The joyful warmth from the smooth road turns into everything you fear when hearing the words ‘red coals.’
      observe: You look down on this path, falling onto the fence for support and feeling it compress under your weight. At your canted angle you notice that the street has a couple different layers of colouration. The smell of burnt rubber snaps into your memory, the last marks of a forgotten friendship. This car left in a hurry, in a rage.
      investigate: The road continues along the fence on the west east axis. The fence is impassible.
    # Gate
    - intro: You try to continue down the road, but you are interrupted by an obstacle. A large tree has crashed on the gate opening the park. Looking at the edge of the road, you cannot help but think that the tree was cut down. The tree has total dominion over
